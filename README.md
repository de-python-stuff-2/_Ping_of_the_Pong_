# _Ping_of_the_Pong_
very nice game and doesn't have any bugs(I think)

BTW this file is here to explain what this game is (supposed) to  be.

_Ping_of_the_Pong_ is like the ping pong on the Atari(search it up), but it has special events or effects like slowed down inputs or something.


Uhh.... I don't know what else to say so... Play the game I guess(if github can actually load it).




I have no idea why you are still reading this. I know it's a read me file but like... LEAVE.




Cheese.
